      <h2>BEYOND FACADE</h2>
      <p1> TOWARDS MUNICH CITY SPACE </p1>
      <p2>
        The facade, as one of the most important elements of the building, forms
        the skin of the city it belongs to. In front of the buildings, the
        pictures show the relationship of the buildings with nature,
        infrastructures, and people’s activities.
      </p2>
      <h3>Urban Life</h3>
      <p3>
        By catching more human activities happening in front of the facade, the
        pictures clue the gene of the city. How do people in the city act? How
        does the city influence life? How do they interact with each other? One
        of the original reasons for architecture is to gather people, such as
        Stonehenge. By the time people like meeting and gathering in the plaza
        which surrounds by a brunch of buildings. So for today what is the role
        of the facade in Munich. Maybe they are fading but there is colourful
        urban life happening in front.

      <h4>Artificial line</h4>
      <img src="./Img/urban/munich6.jpg" alt="munich 6" class="munich-6" />
      <p4>
        There is an important line from west to east, which doesn’t grow from
        the earth. Instead, it is the wisdom of the human after the Industrial
        Revolution, it also hints that this city is located at a special and
        central point in Europe. From1946 to1969 it is a time for Munich on the
        way back to the top. At the end of the Second World War, Munich refaces
        the most difficult economic period in the Company’s history to date. And
        the government decided to rebuild a series of important buildings which
        play different kind of role today. Due to the huge and vital
        infrastructure, it could be a new “landscape” of the city.

      <h5>Natural line</h5>
      <p5>
        In Munich, there is a strong line. The Isar, the most famous river,
        crosses the city from south to north. An alpine river in the heart of
        the city. The Isar flows through Munich from south to north over a
        distance of almost 14 kilometres and, with its flat banks, gravel banks
        and floodplains is today the most important central local reaction area
        in Munich. The urban river restoration project has been in progress on
        the River Isar since the beginning of the year 2000. 
      </p5>
      <p6>
        Within the scope of
        the “Isar Plan” local flood protection is improved and ecologically
        valuable habitats for fauna and flora are restored. At the same time,
        the growing demand of city dwellers for natural landscapes in central
        urban areas for leisure and recreational use is met in an ideal manner.
        In all, the joint project of the State of Bavaria and the City of Munich
        is more than just the restoration of a stretch of the River Isar
        extending over 8 kilometres in the Munich area, it is also an investment
        in the future.
