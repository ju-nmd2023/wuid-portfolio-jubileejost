    <h2>About</h2>
    <p1>
        My name is Yiyang Li, and I am currently a third-year BA architecture student at Iceland University of the Arts. 
        My academic journey has been enriched with diverse experiences in architecture and industrial design. 
        I hold a degree in industrial design, where my focus was on the intricacies of small-scale design. 
        This foundation led me to further explore the realm of architecture through the wood program at Aalto University, Finland, in 2020.<br>
        <br>
        During my time at Aalto University, I had the privilege of participating in a collaborative project that involved designing and constructing a wooden cabin. 
        This hands-on experience allowed me to cultivate a deep appreciation for the intricate relationship between design and materiality. 
        Working alongside my peers and gaining exposure to various wood machinery in the workshop was truly unforgettable and kindled my passion for design through model thinking.<br>
        <br>
        Subsequently, I pursued my architectural studies in Iceland, delving into urban design concepts and exploring the dynamic connection between architecture and geography. 
        As part of an enriching exchange year, I had the opportunity to study at Technische Universität München. 
        This experience not only honed my practical architectural skills but also exposed me to the art of architectural photography analysis under the guidance of the renowned architecture photographer, Erieta Attali.
